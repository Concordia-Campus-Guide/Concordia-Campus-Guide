I chose the  vegetarian main dish which was all about the texture which was great but nothing at all outstanding about the dish. My husband and daughter chose the duck for their main course it was the smallest main course i've ever seen - their faces were priceless when it arrived!.

Given the amount of money spent I feel compelled to stop other people making the same mistake we did. Group booking for 7 people @ 1pm. Decor is dated with purple carpet, red chairs and mirrored roof. Patrons dressed in tee shirts and jeans - dress code should be in place. Everyone opted for the tasting menu with matching wines. Slow cooked Duck was horrible and tough, along with a tasteless Wagyu. Head Sommelier was condescending with rude commentary. Staff started to vacuum around us while we were still having last course, setting up for the next sitting. If you can't fit a tasting menu in for a 1pm booking do not take bookings at that time. Forgot to bring out the petit fours and only served 1 pot of tea for 2 people. Burnt Piccolo was served and we had to ask for it to be remade. We asked for another round of drinks and was told the bar was closed at 5:30pm. Staff were unkempt with uniforms that badly need an update. Overall presentation was dated and unpleasant. Terrible dining experience for a 3 hat restaurant. Spend half your money and eat at Guillaume for better food and nicer people. We are all very disappointed and won't be recommending this restaurant to anyone any time soon. Unfortunately your reputation is keeping you afloat but this will not last long. ",

My husband and I've had our fair share of fine dining experiences around the world and for a restaurant that requires a booking at least three months in advance we were SHOCKED at the quality of food AND service presented tonight.  From rubber-like \"quail\" to a snow-egg that  presents and tastes like vanilla ice cream on crystallised sugar on crushed ice was honestly the best option we experienced from our four poor courses.  Each meal lacked a wow factor in taste and presentation.   $500 later I'd never return and would inform mates to spend their evenings elsewhere.

There is an expectation that patrons should leave feeling full and satisfied rather than yearning for more food and finding the closest fast food outlet outside the restaurant - especially after paying those prices.\n\nFor the most recent upscale restaurants my partner and I have been to, serving sizes have been very reasonable and I don't think Quay have cottoned on to the fact that the servings they provide are simply unacceptable. A distinct lack of adaptability to the ever-changing food industry.\n\nWill not return.",
