/**
 * The Google Distance Matrix API is a service that provides travel distance and time for a matrix
 * of origins and destinations. The information returned is based on the recommended route between
 * start and end points, as calculated by the Google Maps API, and consists of rows containing
 * duration and distance values for each pair.
 *
 * <p>This service does not return detailed route information. Route information can be obtained by
 * passing the desired single origin and destination to the Directions API, using {@link
 * com.google.maps.DirectionsApi}.
 *
 * <p><strong>Note:</strong> Use of the Distance Matrix API must relate to the display of
 * information on a Google Map; for example, to determine origin-destination pairs that fall within
 * a specific driving time from one another, before requesting and displaying those destinations on
 * a map. Use of the service in an application that doesn't display a Google Map is prohibited.
 *
 * @see <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/distancematrix/">Distance Matrix
 *     API Documentation</a>
