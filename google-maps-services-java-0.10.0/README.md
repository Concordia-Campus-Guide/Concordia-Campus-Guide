## Description

Use Java? Want to [geocode][Geocoding API] something? Looking for [directions][Directions API]?
Maybe [matrices of directions][Distance Matrix API]? This library brings the [Google Maps API Web
Services] to your server-side Java application.
![Analytics](https://maps-ga-beacon.appspot.com/UA-12846745-20/google-maps-services-java/readme?pixel)

The Java Client for Google Maps Services is a Java Client library for the following Google Maps
APIs:

- [Directions API]
- [Distance Matrix API]
- [Elevation API]
- [Geocoding API]
- [Maps Static API]
- [Places API]
- [Roads API]
- [Time Zone API]

Keep in mind that the same [terms and conditions](https://developers.google.com/maps/terms) apply
to usage of the APIs when they're accessed through this library.

## Intended usage of this library

The Java Client for Google Maps Services is designed for use in server applications. This library
is not intended for use inside of an Android app, due to the potential for loss of API keys.

If you are building a mobile application, you will need to introduce a proxy server to act as
intermediary between your mobile application and the [Google Maps API Web Services]. The Java
Client for Google Maps Services would make an excellent choice as the basis for such a proxy server.

Please see [Making the most of the Google Maps Web Service APIs] for more detail.

## Support

This library is community supported. We're comfortable enough with the stability and features of
the library that we want you to build real production applications on it. We will try to support,
through Stack Overflow, the public and protected surface of the library and maintain backwards
compatibility in the future; however, while the library is in version 0.x, we reserve the right
to make backwards-incompatible changes. If we do remove some functionality (typically because
better functionality exists or if the feature proved infeasible), our intention is to deprecate
and give developers a year to update their code.

If you find a bug, or have a feature suggestion, please [log an issue][issues]. If you'd like to
contribute, please read [How to Contribute][contrib].

## Requirements

- Java 1.8 or later.
- A Google Maps API key.

### API keys

Each Google Maps Web Service request requires an API key or client ID. API keys
are freely available with a Google Account at
[developers.google.com/console](https://developers.google.com/console). The
type of API key you need is a **Server key**.

To get an API key:

 1. Visit [developers.google.com/console](https://developers.google.com/console)
  and log in with a Google Account.
 1. Select one of your existing projects, or create a new project.
 1. Enable the API(s) you want to use. The Java Client for Google Maps Services
    accesses the following APIs:
    - Directions API
    - Distance Matrix API
    - Elevation API
    - Geocoding API
    - Maps Static API
    - Places API
    - Roads API
    - Time Zone API
 1. Create a new **Server key**.
 1. If you'd like to restrict requests to a specific IP address, do so now.

For guided help, follow the instructions for the [Directions API][directions-key].
You only need one API key, but remember to enable all the APIs you need.
For even more information, see the guide to [API keys][apikey].

**Important:** This key should be kept secret on your server.

## Installation

You can add the library to your project via Maven or Gradle.

**Note:** Since 0.1.18 there is now a dependency on [SLF4J](https://www.slf4j.org/). You need to add
one of the adapter dependencies that makes sense for your logging setup. In the configuration
samples below we are integrating
[slf4j-nop](https://search.maven.org/#artifactdetails%7Corg.slf4j%7Cslf4j-nop%7C1.7.25%7Cjar),
but there are others like
[slf4j-log4j12](https://search.maven.org/#artifactdetails%7Corg.slf4j%7Cslf4j-log4j12%7C1.7.25%7Cjar)
and [slf4j-jdk14](https://search.maven.org/#artifactdetails%7Corg.slf4j%7Cslf4j-jdk14%7C1.7.25%7Cjar)
that will make more sense in other configurations. This will stop a warning message being emitted
when you start using `google-maps-services`.

### Maven

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.google.maps</groupId>
  <artifactId>google-maps-services</artifactId>
  <version>(insert latest version)</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.slf4j</groupId>
  <artifactId>slf4j-simple</artifactId>
  <version>1.7.25</version>
</dependency>
```

### Gradle

```groovy
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    implementation 'com.google.maps:google-maps-services:(insert latest version)'
    implementation 'org.slf4j:slf4j-simple:1.7.25'
}
```

You can find the latest version at the top of this README or by [searching
Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ca%3A%22google-maps-services%22) or [Gradle, Please](http://gradleplease.appspot.com/#google-maps-services).

## Developer Documentation

View the [javadoc](https://googlemaps.github.io/google-maps-services-java/v0.10.0/javadoc/index.html?overview-summary.html).

Additional documentation for the included web services is available at
https://developers.google.com/maps/.

- [Directions API]
- [Distance Matrix API]
- [Elevation API]
- [Geocoding API]
- [Maps Static API]
- [Places API]
- [Roads API]
- [Time Zone API]

## Usage

This example uses the [Geocoding API] with an API key:

```java
GeoApiContext context = new GeoApiContext.Builder()
    .apiKey("AIza...")
    .build();
GeocodingResult[] results =  GeocodingApi.geocode(context,
    "1600 Amphitheatre Parkway Mountain View, CA 94043").await();
Gson gson = new GsonBuilder().setPrettyPrinting().create();
System.out.println(gson.toJson(results[0].addressComponents));
```

Below is the same example, using client ID and client secret (digital signature)
for authentication. This code assumes you have previously loaded the `clientID`
and `clientSecret` variables with appropriate values.

For a guide on how to generate the `clientSecret` (digital signature), see the
documentation for the API you're using. For example, see the guide for the
[Directions API][directions-client-id].

```java
GeoApiContext context = new GeoApiContext.Builder()
    .enterpriseCredentials(clientID, clientSecret)
    .build();
GeocodingResult[] results =  GeocodingApi.geocode(context,
    "1600 Amphitheatre Parkway Mountain View, CA 94043").await();
Gson gson = new GsonBuilder().setPrettyPrinting().create();
System.out.println(gson.toJson(results[0].addressComponents));
```

The `GeoApiContext` is designed to be a [Singleton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern)
in your application. Please instantiate one on application startup, and continue to use it for the
life of your application. This will enable proper QPS enforcement across all of your requests.

For more usage examples, check out [the tests](src/test/java/com/google/maps).

## Features

### Google App Engine Support

You can use this client library on Google App Engine with a single code change.

```java
new GeoApiContext.Builder(new GaeRequestHandler.Builder())
    .apiKey("AIza...")
    .build();
```

The `new GaeRequestHandler.Builder()` argument to `GeoApiContext.Builder`'s `requestHandlerBuilder`
tells the Java Client for Google Maps Services to utilise the appropriate calls for making HTTP
requests from Google App Engine, instead of the default [OkHttp3](https://square.github.io/okhttp/)
based strategy.

### Rate Limiting

Never sleep between requests again! By default, requests are sent at the expected rate limits for
each web service, typically 50 queries per second for free users. If you want to speed up or slow
down requests, you can do that too, using `new GeoApiContext.Builder().queryRateLimit(qps).build()`.
Note that you still need to manually handle the [delay between the initial request and successive pages](https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/search#PlaceSearchPaging) when you're paging through multiple result sets.

### Retry on Failure

Automatically retry when intermittent failures occur. That is, when any of the retriable 5xx errors
are returned from the API.

To alter or disable automatic retries, see these methods in `GeoApiContext`:

- `.disableRetries()`
- `.maxRetries()`
- `.retryTimeout()`
- `.setIfExceptionIsAllowedToRetry()`

### Client IDs

Google Maps APIs Premium Plan customers can use their [client ID and secret][clientid] to
authenticate, instead of an API key.

### POJOs

Native objects for each of the API responses.

### Asynchronous or synchronous -- you choose

All requests support synchronous or asynchronous calling style.

```java
GeocodingApiRequest req = GeocodingApi.newRequest(context).address("Sydney");

// Synchronous
try {
    req.await();
    // Handle successful request.
} catch (Exception e) {
    // Handle error
}

req.awaitIgnoreError(); // No checked exception.

// Async
req.setCallback(new PendingResult.Callback<GeocodingResult[]>() {
  @Override
  public void onResult(GeocodingResult[] result) {
    // Handle successful request.
  }

  @Override
  public void onFailure(Throwable e) {
    // Handle error.
  }
});
```
